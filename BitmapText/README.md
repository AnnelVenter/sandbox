EaselJS BitmapText
=======

Use an SpriteSheet as a source for a bitmap font.
Adapted from an idea provided by David Deraedt [BitmapText Class](http://www.dehats.com/drupal/node/116).

Important notes:

* Characters are referenced using named animations in the SpriteSheet format.
* Support for any character that has a matching definition.
* Additional support for line break (\n) and space "characters"
* Characters will default to lowercase/uppercase variants
* No support for wrapping
* Requires EaselJS 0.6

**Bitmap Font**<br />
The Bitmap Font was generated using the [Prep for Zo&euml; JSFL command](http://gskinner.com/blog/archives/2012/08/prep-for-zoe-jsfl-command.html)
(included in the repository), and the [Zo&euml; Air application](http://createjs.com/zoe). The original PSD, exported
letters, export FLA and SWF are also included. Note that it is recommended to use variable frame sizes to get better
letter spacing when using a variable-size font.
