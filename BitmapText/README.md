Important notes:

* The included demo must be run from a server to load correctly.
* The example font has not been adjusted for correct kerning / letter placement.
* Characters are referenced using named animations in the sprite sheet.
* Additional support for line break (\n) and space "characters"
* Characters will default to lowercase/uppercase variants
* No support for wrapping
* Requires EaselJS 0.6

**Bitmap Font**<br />
The Bitmap Font was generated using the [Prep for Zo&euml; JSFL command](http://gskinner.com/blog/archives/2012/08/prep-for-zoe-jsfl-command.html)
(included in the repository), and the [Zo&euml; Air application](http://createjs.com/zoe). The original PSD, exported
letters, export FLA and SWF are also included. Note that it is recommended to use variable frame sizes to get better
letter spacing when using a variable-size font.
