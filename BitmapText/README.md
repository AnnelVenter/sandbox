EaseJS Bitmap Font
=======

Use an SpriteSheet as a source for a bitmap font. It is recommended to use Flash Pro and ZoÃ« (http://createjs.com/zoe) with named frame labels for each character.

Adapted from an idea provided by David Deraedt (http://www.dehats.com/drupal/node/116)

Important notes:
- Characters are referenced using named animations in the SpriteSheet format.
- Support for any character that has a matching definition.
- Additional support for line break (\n) and space "characters"
- Characters will default to lowercase/uppercase variants
- No support for wrapping
- Requires EaselJS 0.6
