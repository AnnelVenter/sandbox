FastContainer
=======

FastContainer (name TBD) provides a fast method of rendering Bitmap or BitmapAnimation instances for uses such as particle and game engines. Supports a limited subset of display list functionality, including: x/y, scaleX/Y, regX/Y, and alpha. Unsupported features on children of FastContainer include rotation, skewX/Y, mask, and shadows.
