Kaleidoscope
=======

Shows an example of embedding a CreateJS-based interactive learning piece into a larger document.

This is to demonstrate how to approach similar scenarios, not to showcase the interactive capabilities of the CreateJS libraries (ie. the actual interactive piece is intentionally very simple).

Highlights:
- less than 2kb over-the-wire size (gzipped, excluding CDN libraries)
- touch / mobile friendly interactive
- image fallback for older browsers
- render only occurs during interaction, saving CPU and battery
- uses hand cursor to indicate interactive elements
