Kaleidoscope
=======

Shows an example of embedding a CreateJS-based interactive learning piece into a larger document.

This is to demonstrate how to approach similar scenarios, not to showcase the interactive capabilities of the CreateJS libraries (ie. the actual interactive piece is intentionally very simple).

![ScreenShot](https://raw.github.com/CreateJS/sandbox/master/eLearning_Lever/README_1.jpg)

Highlights:
- touch / mobile friendly (though page is not responsive)
- image fallback for older browsers
- render only occurs during interaction, saving CPU and battery
- uses hand cursor to indicate interactive elements
